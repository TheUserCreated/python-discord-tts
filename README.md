# python-discord-tts

This is a simple discord TTS bot that I made in one day
I hope it's good, if you have any suggestions please give them!
The commands are as follows:

.join

(joins the invokers current voice channel, gets angry if they're not in one)

.leave

(leaves the current voice channel, gets angry if it's not in one)

.say Your Phrase Here

(says whatever you want in the current voice channel, if it is not in one then it joins the invokers current voice channel)

If the bot is currently speaking and someone issues another .say command, it is queued and will play as soon as the previous is over.
